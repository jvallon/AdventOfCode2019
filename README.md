# AdventOfCode2019
The programs in this repository are my solutions to the 2019 [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) event. Each day has two solutions contained within a single Program.cs file. 

I chose C# because I want practice in it. 

# Considerations
These programs are not meant to be robust designs. They are a means to find a solution to the problems provided in the advent calendar. 

# Dependencies
These programs are built using dotnet core 3, but should work in most .net versions (framework, standard, core). 

# Running the programs
You can use `dotnet build` to compile these programs and then run the executable, but I would recommend opening the folder in VSCode and running the program from their.
